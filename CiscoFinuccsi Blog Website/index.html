      Another overdue and lengthy podcast. In this episode, the twins take it back with Gabriella Coleman and chat about the history of Anonymous and the current state of whistleblowing and hacktivism.
The twins also talk about the continued fallout of Jan 6 and the current state of MAGA in the year since the right-wing insurrection, including a new section, “Where Are They Now?”, about the so-called “political prisoners” of Jan 6, portrayed as martyrs by the fascistic GOP. In seamless transition, the twins then discuss the new version of their game Smash MAGA.
Also appearing on this podcast is Manilo and Paul of the hardcore band La Armada, whose music is featured throughout the episode. The conversation details the trials and tribulations of the DIY punk scene during the pandemic.

      his is a special episode we’re recording for June 11th International Day of Solidarity with Marius Mason & All Long-Term Anarchist Prisoners. The twins share reflections on prisoner support in general but also in the context of the recent anniversary of the George Floyd uprising, where thousands are facing repression for fighting back against racist cops. Also plenty of thoughts on recent hacks and leaks, and the political ramifications of these high-profile ransomware attacks against Colonial Pipeline, the MPD, Citizen App, and Jones Day leaks.

Featuring music by Sacral, raw-ish black metal dipping its toes in punk, post-black, DSBM, and crust. Seeker of gnarly riffs
